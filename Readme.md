# Unity Space Shooter
A small project I am doing in my spare time using th Unity3D engine. Just to test out some design patterns, and checking how they all fit toghether.

## How to play
There is really not a lot going on this ""game"" You can either play with your mouse, or with your keyboard:
* Mouse: You can move around with your mouse, and shoot with a left mouse button click
* Keyboard: Move around with your arrow keys, and shoot with the space bar.

You can pause at anytime with the Esc key.
